For accuracy in coding, one would typically seek a code specifically designed for forearm injuries, which are not listed in the provided category.\n\n**Note:** For comprehensive coding, additional categories (e.g., S50-S59 for forearm injuries) would be necessary to fully capture all injuries described in the diagnosis."
